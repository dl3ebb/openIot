# openIot
IoT library based on ESP32 Module. It includes connectivity to MQTT, NTP and syslog for central logging. It also provides functionality for an update server and auto update the module. For the web user interface a websocket based ui is provided with various widgets. 

I use this library for various iot projects. It will probably grow as soon as i need new features for the project. If you find something missing, feel free to send me a pull request.
